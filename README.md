usefullScripts
==============

A collection of scripts, I have created. They normally are usefull to me, and
possibly can be usefill for somone else.

addGpxElevationData.py
----------------------

With this script elevation data can be added to a gpx file. To do so,
go to http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/elevation and create a gpx file with
elevation data from your gpx file w/o elevation data. Then call this
script with both filenames as arguments. The gpx file with elevation data
will be written to stdout.
